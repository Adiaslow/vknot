    labFocus: "The structural complexity of many natural products sets them apart from common synthetic drugs, allowing them to access a biological target space that lies beyond the enzyme active sites and receptors targeted by conventional small molecule drugs. Naturally occurring cyclic peptides, in particular, exhibit a range of biological activities whose diversity is reflected in their rich structural variety. Many of these compounds penetrate cells by passive diffusion and some, like cyclosporine A, are clinically used, orally bioavailable drugs. These natural products tend to have molecular weights and polar group counts that put them outside the norm based on classic predictors of \"drug-likeness\". Because of their size and complexity, cyclic peptides can show greater specificity and potency for biological targets compared to smaller acyclic compounds, and they may provide useful scaffolds for modulating more challenging biological targets such as protein-protein interactions and allosteric binding sites. The lab's research focuses on cyclic peptide natural products from a structural perspective, in the hope of uncovering trends that might account for their unexpected pharmacokinetic behavior. Additionally, the lab develops DNA-encoded cyclic peptide libraries using combinatorial strategies for high-throughput reaction profiling and physicochemical assessment of DNA-peptide conjugates to target protein-protein interactions related to uncontrolled cell proliferation. The lab has also expanded interests into targeted protein degradation, providing tools to assess and optimize the ADME profile of degraders such as molecular glues and PROTACs.",

    labFocus: "The mammalian cortex is composed of numerous functionally specialized areas. Interactions between these areas, mediated by widespread yet precise cell type specific circuits, are central to the neural computations that generate perception, cognition, and behavior. The laboratory focuses on understanding the organizational logic of long-distance cortical circuits and the molecular mechanisms of their development using mouse visual cortex as a model. In the mature brain, the lab investigates the identities of brain-wide input and output neurons and their functional contributions to information processing using novel trans-synaptic tracers and in vivo imaging. In the developing brain, the lab examines how genetic programs and neuronal activity interact to construct connectivity, addressing how a population of neural progenitors in a single cortical area develops into diverse subtypes each projecting to particular brain areas and receiving specific brain-wide inputs. These fundamental questions are addressed using novel neural circuit tracing systems with next-generation trans-synaptic viral tracers, mouse genetics, single-cell genome-wide sequencing, and in vivo imaging to understand how specific long-distance neural circuits are developed and organized at the single cell level, ultimately providing insights into neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.",

    labFocus: "The laboratory's research interests and expertise encompass neuroscience, protein structure, computational biology, and evolution. The main focus is on structure and function studies of voltage-gated ion channels, computational design and chemical synthesis of subtype-specific modulators of voltage-gated ion channels, development of computational methods for membrane protein structure prediction and design, and analysis of evolution of human voltage-gated ion channels. Function and modulation of neuronal sodium channels are critical for the neuromodulation of electrical excitability and synaptic transmission in neurons. The laboratory focuses on studying neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels structure, function, and modulation in order to design new therapeutically useful drugs for treatment of pain and epilepsy. The lab uses an innovative approach to design novel subtype selective Nav channel blocking drugs with high efficacy and minimum side effects, which are tested using methods of electrophysiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. This research provides key structural information on the molecular basis of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels function and its interaction with therapeutically useful subtype-specific modulators, giving profound insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying neuromodulation and signal transduction.",
