## Abstract

We present a theoretical framework for molecular embeddings based on parallel hierarchical decomposition, motivated by the unique challenges of cyclic peptide drug discovery. Unlike traditional nested hierarchies, our approach maintains two parallel organizational views—synthetic fragments and biological residues—that capture orthogonal chemical principles. We prove that this parallel structure preserves more information than serial hierarchies, enables efficient long-range interaction modeling, and naturally represents the dual nature of modified cyclic peptides. The framework is particularly suited for permeability prediction, where both synthetic accessibility and biological activity contribute to drug-like properties.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Cyclic Peptide Permeability Challenge

Cyclic peptides occupy a unique space in drug discovery—large enough to target "undruggable" protein-protein interactions, yet potentially permeable enough to be orally bioavailable. The key challenge is predicting and optimizing cell permeability, which depends on a complex interplay of factors:

- **Molecular size and lipophilicity** (traditional drug-like properties)
- **Intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (shielding polar groups)
- **Conformational flexibility** (ability to adopt permeable conformations)
- **Non-canonical modifications** (N-methylation, D-amino acids, unusual residues)

These properties emerge from both the peptide sequence (biological view) and chemical modifications (synthetic view), neither of which fully captures the complete picture.

### 1.2 The Representation Problem

Traditional molecular representations force a choice:

**Option 1: Chemical graph representation**

- Treats all atoms equally
- Loses peptide sequence information
- Computationally expensive for large molecules

**Option 2: Sequence-based representation**

- Preserves biological information
- Loses chemical modification details
- Fails for non-canonical residues

**Option 3: Hierarchical representation**

- Atoms → Functional groups → Molecule
- Creates information bottleneck
- Forces single organizational view

For modified cyclic peptides—with N-methylations, D-amino acids, and non-natural residues—none of these approaches is sufficient.

### 1.3 Our Contribution

We propose a **parallel hierarchical decomposition** that maintains both synthetic and biological views simultaneously:

```
        Atoms
       /      \
  Fragments  Residues
       \      /
       Molecule
```

This structure:

1. **Preserves more information** than serial hierarchies (proven via information theory)
2. **Enables cross-level interactions** between fragments and residues
3. **Naturally represents** modified cyclic peptides
4. **Facilitates learning** of permeability-relevant features

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Information-Theoretic Analysis

### Definition 2.1 (Serial Hierarchical Decomposition)

A serial hierarchy processes information through a single intermediate level:

$$\text{Atoms } (A) \to \text{Hierarchy } (H) \to \text{Molecule } (M)$$

### Definition 2.2 (Parallel Hierarchical Decomposition)

A parallel hierarchy processes information through multiple independent levels:

$$\text{Atoms } (A) \to \{\text{Fragments } (F), \text{Residues } (R)\} \to \text{Molecule } (M)$$

### Theorem 2.1 (Information Preservation)

Parallel decomposition preserves at least as much information as any serial decomposition.

### Proof

Let $I(A; M)$ be the mutual information between atoms and molecular properties.

For serial decomposition:
By the data processing inequality:

$$I(A; M) \leq I(A; H) \leq H(A)$$

For parallel decomposition:
Using the chain rule of mutual information:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I(A; M|F,R) &= I(A; M,F,R) - I(A; F,R) \\
&= I(A; M) + I(A; F,R|M) - I(A; F,R)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $F$ and $R$ are both functions of $A$:

$$I(A; F,R) = H(F,R) - H(F,R|A) = H(F,R)$$

By conditioning reduces entropy:

$$I(A; M|F,R) \geq \max(I(A; M|F), I(A; M|R))$$

Since any serial hierarchy $H$ can be viewed as either $F$ or $R$ alone:

$$I(A; M|F,R) \geq I(A; M|H)$$

Therefore, parallel decomposition preserves at least as much information. ∎

### 2.2 Graph-Theoretic Framework

### Definition 2.3 (Molecular Partition)

A partition $\pi$ of atomic set $A$ groups atoms into disjoint subsets.

### Definition 2.4 (Fragment Partition)

$\pi_F$ groups atoms by synthetic building blocks (e.g., BRICS decomposition).

### Definition 2.5 (Residue Partition)

$\pi_R$ groups atoms by biological units (amino acid residues).

**Lemma 2.2 (Partition Refinement):**

The meet (intersection) of two partitions provides finer granularity than either partition alone.

### Proof

For partitions $\pi_F$ and $\pi_R$, their meet $\pi_F \wedge \pi_R$ is defined as:

$$\pi_F \wedge \pi_R = \{B_i \cap B_j \mid B_i \in \pi_F, B_j \in \pi_R, B_i \cap B_j \neq \emptyset\}$$

The entropy of a partition $H(\pi) = -\sum_i (|B_i|/n) \log(|B_i|/n)$.

Since each block in $\pi_F \wedge \pi_R$ is a subset of blocks in both $\pi_F$ and $\pi_R$:

$$|\text{blocks}(\pi_F \wedge \pi_R)| \geq \max(|\text{blocks}(\pi_F)|, |\text{blocks}(\pi_R)|)$$

Therefore:

$$H(\pi_F \wedge \pi_R) \geq \max(H(\pi_F), H(\pi_R))$$

The finer partition captures more structural information. ∎

### 2.3 Attention-Based Long-Range Interactions

### Definition 2.6 (Graph Distance)

In a molecular graph $G$, $d(i,j)$ is the shortest path between atoms $i$ and $j$.

### Definition 2.7 (Attention Mechanism)

Attention computes pairwise relevance scores:

$$\text{Attention}(i,j) = \text{softmax}(Q_i \cdot K_j^T / \sqrt{d})$$

### Theorem 2.3 (Information Flow Complexity)

Message passing requires $O(\text{diameter}(G))$ steps for global information flow, while attention requires $O(1)$ steps.

### Proof

In message passing with $k$ iterations:

- Information from node $i$ reaches nodes within distance $k$
- Full propagation requires $k = \text{diameter}(G)$ iterations
- Time complexity: $O(\text{diameter}(G) \times |E|)$

With attention mechanism:

- All pairs compute attention scores simultaneously
- Information flows directly between any pair
- Time complexity: $O(|V|^2)$ but depth $O(1)$

For cyclic peptides, $\text{diameter}(G) \approx n/2$ for $n$ residues, making attention significantly more efficient for long-range interactions. ∎

## 3. The Parallel Hierarchical Framework

### 3.1 Formal Construction

### Definition 3.1 (Parallel Hierarchical Molecular Graph)

A tuple $(A, F, R, M, \varphi_F, \varphi_R, \psi)$ where:

- $A$ = atomic features $\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_a}$
- $F$ = fragment features $\in \mathbb{R}^{k_f \times d_f}$
- $R$ = residue features $\in \mathbb{R}^{k_r \times d_r}$
- $M$ = molecular features $\in \mathbb{R}^{d_m}$
- $\varphi_F: A \to F$ (fragment assignment)
- $\varphi_R: A \to R$ (residue assignment)
- $\psi: F \times R \to M$ (molecular composition)

### 3.2 Cross-Level Interactions

### Definition 3.2 (Fragment-Residue Interaction Tensor)

$T \in \mathbb{R}^{k_f \times k_r \times d_c}$ captures interactions between fragments and residues.

For cyclic peptides, this captures critical relationships:

- N-methylation (fragment) on specific residues affects permeability
- D-amino acids (residue property) influence backbone conformation
- Aromatic fragments participate in π-π stacking across residues

### 3.3 Permeability-Relevant Features

The parallel structure naturally captures permeability determinants:

**Fragment Level**:

- Lipophilic groups (permeability enhancers)
- Polar functional groups (permeability barriers)
- Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors

**Residue Level**:

- Sequence patterns (e.g., Pro-Pro for rigidity)
- D/L stereochemistry
- N-methylation patterns

**Cross-Level**:

- Intramolecular hydrogen bonds (polar group shielding)
- Aromatic-aromatic interactions
- Modification-sequence compatibility

## 4. Theoretical Properties

### 4.1 Representational Capacity

### Theorem 4.1 (Capacity Bound)

The parallel hierarchy has higher representational capacity than any single hierarchy.

### Proof

Representational capacity can be measured by the dimension of the feature space.

Single hierarchy:

$$\dim(H) = k_h \times d_h$$

Parallel hierarchy:

$$\dim(F \times R) = k_f \times d_f + k_r \times d_r + k_f \times k_r \times d_c$$

The cross-term $k_f \times k_r \times d_c$ represents additional capacity from interactions.

For cyclic peptides:

- $k_f \approx$ number of modification types
- $k_r \approx$ number of residues
- Cross-term grows as $O(k_f \times k_r)$

Therefore:

$$\dim(F \times R) > \dim(H) \text{ for any } H \text{ with comparable complexity}$$

Therefore, the parallel hierarchy has higher representational capacity. ∎

### 4.2 Gradient Flow Properties

### Theorem 4.2 (Gradient Robustness)

Parallel pathways reduce gradient vanishing probability.

### Proof

Let p be the probability of gradient vanishing through a single path.

Serial hierarchy:

$$P(\text{gradient reaches atoms}) = 1 - p$$

Parallel hierarchy with independent pathways:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{gradient vanishes}) &= P(\text{both paths fail}) = p^2 \\
P(\text{gradient reaches atoms}) &= 1 - p^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $p \in (0,1)$:

$$1 - p^2 > 1 - p$$

The parallel structure provides gradient flow redundancy. ∎

### 4.3 Compositional Learning

### Definition 4.1 (Compositional Rules)

Learned mappings that generalize to novel combinations:

- Fragment compatibility: P(f_i connects to f_j)
- Residue compatibility: P(r_i follows r_j)
- Cross-level compatibility: P(f_i compatible with r_j)

### Conjecture 4.1: The parallel hierarchy learns compositional rules that generalize to novel modified peptides.

**Supporting argument** (not a proof)
The architecture separates:

1. Local chemical rules (fragments)
2. Sequential patterns (residues)
3. Interaction rules (cross-level)

This factorization encourages learning reusable components rather than memorizing complete structures.

## 5. Application to Cyclic Peptide Permeability

### 5.1 Why Parallel Hierarchy Suits Cyclic Peptides

Cyclic peptides have inherent dual nature:

**Biological organization** (Residues)

```
CYCLO(Arg-D-Phe-Pro-NMe-Val-Leu)
```

- Sequence determines backbone conformation
- Residue properties affect recognition

**Synthetic organization** (Fragments)

```
Guanidine-Phenyl-Pyrrolidine-NMethyl-Isopropyl-Isobutyl
```

- Functional groups determine lipophilicity
- Modifications affect permeability

Neither view is complete; both are necessary.

### 5.2 Permeability Feature Extraction

The parallel hierarchy naturally extracts permeability-relevant features:

### Theorem 5.1 (Feature Completeness)

The parallel decomposition captures all first-order permeability determinants.

Proof sketch:
Permeability determinants include:

1. Size/lipophilicity → captured by fragment features
2. Hydrogen bonding → fragment-residue interactions
3. Flexibility → residue sequence patterns
4. Charge distribution → both levels contribute

Each determinant maps to architectural components:

- Fragments encode chemical properties
- Residues encode conformational preferences
- Cross-attention captures shielding effects

The parallel structure spans the space of permeability features. ∎

### 5.3 Modified Residue Representation

### Example N-methylated leucine

Traditional hierarchy struggles:

- Is it a modified leucine? (residue view)
- Is it a specific chemical structure? (fragment view)

Parallel hierarchy:

- Residue level: Leucine-like backbone position
- Fragment level: N-methyl modification, isobutyl side chain
- Cross-level: N-methylation at this position affects backbone flexibility

This factorization enables generalization to novel modifications.

## 6. Theoretical Implications

### 6.1 Connection to Multi-View Learning

The parallel hierarchy implements a form of multi-view learning where views are:

1. **Structurally coupled** (share atomic foundation)
2. **Semantically distinct** (capture different chemical principles)
3. **Mutually informative** (cross-level interactions)

This relates to co-training and multi-kernel learning theory.

### 6.2 Inductive Biases

The architecture encodes strong but complementary biases:

**Fragment bias**: Local chemical environment determines properties

- Matches medicinal chemistry intuition
- Enables fragment-based drug design reasoning

**Residue bias**: Sequence patterns determine structure

- Matches peptide chemistry knowledge
- Enables sequence-based optimization

By maintaining both biases simultaneously, the model avoids premature commitment to a single view.

### 6.3 Theoretical Limitations

**Limitation 1**: Not all molecules benefit from dual representation

- Small molecules may not have meaningful residue structure
- Proteins might need additional hierarchical levels

**Limitation 2**: Optimal decomposition is task-dependent

- Different partitions might suit different properties
- No universal "best" decomposition exists

**Limitation 3**: Computational overhead

- Maintains multiple feature sets
- Requires cross-level attention computation

## 7. Experimental Directions

While this work focuses on theoretical foundations, the framework suggests several testable hypotheses:

### 7.1 Compositional Generalization

**Hypothesis**: Models using parallel hierarchy should better generalize to:

- Novel combinations of known modifications
- Longer/shorter peptide sequences
- Different cyclization patterns

### 7.2 Interpretability

**Hypothesis**: Learned attention patterns should reveal:

- Which modifications affect permeability
- Critical fragment-residue interactions
- Structural motifs for permeability

### 7.3 Transfer Learning

**Hypothesis**: The factorized representation should enable:

- Transfer between peptide families
- Knowledge sharing across modification types
- Few-shot learning for novel residues

## 8. Related Theoretical Frameworks

### 8.1 Connection to Category Theory

The parallel decomposition can be viewed as a **span** in the category of molecular representations:

```
    F ← A → R
```

with the molecular level as the **pushout** combining both views.

### 8.2 Connection to Information Geometry

The parallel hierarchy defines a **product manifold**:

```
M_molecule = M_fragment × M_residue
```

with the Riemannian metric incorporating both geometric structures.

### 8.3 Connection to Tensor Decomposition

The framework performs an implicit **tensor factorization**:

```
T_molecule ≈ T_atom ×₁ U_fragment ×₂ U_residue ×₃ U_interaction
```

similar to Tucker decomposition but with chemical constraints.
