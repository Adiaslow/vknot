        I'm a computational cyclic peptide drug discovery researcher specializing in
        geometric deep learning for molecular design and property prediction.

        This site is a research notebook where I share work that I find novel, scientifically
        valuable, mathematically beautiful, or just plain fun. Posts range from rigorous
        theoretical frameworks to playful explorations, and include both complete work
        and ideas with theoretical foundations awaiting implementation.

      <p>
        The posts here are representative examples of my work and interests, unified by
        an emphasis on mathematical rigor, computational methods, and the occasional
        delightful tangent into game theory or cellular automata.
