        I'm a computational researcher working at the intersection of pure
        mathematics and drug discovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I serve work as an undergraduate researcher in three labs:
        the Lokey Lab and the Kim Lab at UC Santa Cruz and the Yarov-Yarovoy Lab
        at UC Davis. I develope geometric deep learning and more traditional
        computataional chemistry methods for cyclic peptide drug design and
        molecular property prediction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The posts here range from peer-review-ready theoretical frameworks to
        playful mathematical explorations. What unifies them is the conviction
        that mathematical rigor and computational practicality aren't opposing
        forcesâ€”they're complementary tools for understanding complex systems.
      </p>

      <p>Common threads throughout this work:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Designed constraints that paradoxically improve efficiency</li>
        <li>Graph-theoretic approaches to chemical problems</li>
        <li>Information-theoretic bounds and optimal sampling strategies</li>
        <li>Algorithms with proven optimality guarantees</li>
        <li>Geometric and topological methods in molecular analysis</li>
        <li>Emergent phenomena in competitive systems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Beyond research, I play multiple instruments, produce and compose
        multiple genres of music, run a record label, write existentialist
        science fiction, develope computer games, and create generative art, and
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether proving theoretical bounds or exploring game-theoretic dynamics,
        the goal remains constant: illuminate the mathematical beauty underlying
        natural and designed systems, then use that understanding to build
        something better.
